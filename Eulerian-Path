What conditions are required for a valid Eulerian Path/Circuit?
That depends on what kind of graph youâ€™re dealing with. Altogether there are four flavors of the Euler path/circuit problem we care about:

Graph Type	          Eulerian Circuit	                                                      Eulerian Path
Undirected Graph	  Every vertex has an even degree.	                  Either every vertex has an even degree or exactly two vertices have odd degree.
Directed Graph	    Every vertex has equal indegree and outdegree.	    At most one vertex has (outdegree - indegree) = 1, and at most one vertex has (indegree - outdegree) = 1, and all other vertices have equal in and out degrees.
