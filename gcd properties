gcd property:

gcd(x,y) == gcd(x,(y-x))  --> x<y

proof :
gcd(x,y)=g;
x= g*a;
y= g*b;
y-x=g*(b-a);



this can be extended to multiple args as well


gcd(a,b,c,d) ---> a<b<c<d

=gcd(a,b,gcd(c,d))
=gcd(a,b,c,d-c);
=gcd(a,gcd(b,c),d-c)
=gcd(a,b,c-b,d-c)
=gcd(a,b-a,c-b,d-c)

This can be written like this as well gcd(a,b,c,d)=gcd(a,b-a,c-a,d-a)
